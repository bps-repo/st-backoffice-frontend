# Employee Creation Revamp

This document summarizes the changes made to revamp the employee creation functionality to match the new API request structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Models (`src/app/core/models/`)

#### User Model (`auth/user.ts`)
- Added `dateOfBirth` field for consistency with the new structure
- Added optional `password` field for creation requests  
- Added optional `additionalPermissionIds` array for additional permissions
- Created new `CreateUserRequest` interface for user creation

#### Employee Model (`corporate/employee.ts`)
- Added `CreateEmployeeRequest` interface that matches the exact structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    user: CreateUserRequest;
    role: string; // Role ID
    centerId: string;
    status: EmployeeStatus;
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Service (`src/app/core/services/employee.service.ts`)
- Updated `createEmployee` method to accept `CreateEmployeeRequest` type
- Improved type safety with proper return types

### 3. Updated NgRx Store (`src/app/core/store/corporate/employees/`)

#### Actions (`employees.actions.ts`)
- Added new actions for employee creation:
  - `Create Employee`
  - `Create Employee Success` 
  - `Create Employee Failure`

#### Effects (`employees.effects.ts`)
- Added `createEmployee$` effect to handle employee creation flow

### 4. Updated Create Component (`src/app/features/corporate/features/employees/pages/create/`)

#### TypeScript (`create.component.ts`)
- Updated imports to include new interfaces
- Added center dropdown support with NgRx store integration
- Updated `onSubmit()` method to create request body matching exact structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    user: {
      firstname: "Enoque",
      lastname: "Silva", 
      gender: "FEMALE",
      dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01",
      email: "bruna-salles@example.com",
      password: "SecurePass123",
      additionalPermissionIds: ["092dd384-...", "fc244589-..."],
      photo: "https://example.com/user.jpg"
    },
    role: "0d63ce23-42bd-443e-8325-87f6c9f4ccfd",
    centerId: "14db16e5-e522-4b4e-be05-6aaacf326a2b", 
    status: "ACTIVE"
  }
  ```
- Removed unnecessary fields (hiringDate, wage) from form
- Added center loading and dropdown integration

#### HTML Template (`create.component.html`)
- Removed hiring date and wage fields (no longer part of new structure)
- Updated center field from text input to dropdown with center options
- **NEW**: Replaced tree-based permission selector with intuitive card-based interface
- Maintained all existing validation

### 5. New Permission Selector Component (`src/app/shared/components/permission-selector/`)

#### New Card-Based Permission UI
- **Replaced complex tree dropdown** with user-friendly card interface
- **Smart categorization**: Permissions automatically grouped by feature area
- **Role integration**: Shows which permissions come from selected role (disabled)
- **Additional permissions**: Clear distinction for extra permissions beyond role
- **Visual feedback**: Selection counts, badges, and color coding
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Better accessibility**: Larger click targets, clearer labels

## New Request Body Structure

The employee creation now sends the exact structure as specified:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "firstname": "Enoque",
    "lastname": "Silva",
    "gender": "FEMALE", 
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "email": "bruna-salles@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123",
    "additionalPermissionIds": [
      "092dd384-d8cc-4dfc-9d52-17176877b1fc",
      "fc244589-dcbe-4e31-865e-ccdbfe13eafb"
    ],
    "photo": "https://example.com/user.jpg"
  },
  "role": "0d63ce23-42bd-443e-8325-87f6c9f4ccfd",
  "centerId": "14db16e5-e522-4b4e-be05-6aaacf326a2b",
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```
