# Permission Tree Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Permission Service Enhancement

The `PermissionService` was updated to properly organize permissions into a hierarchical structure. The key changes include:

- Added a new `buildPermissionTree` method that:
  - Creates a deep copy of permissions to avoid modifying the original data
  - Builds parent-child relationships by replacing child references with full child objects
  - Identifies root permissions (those that aren't children of any other permission)
  - Returns only root permissions with their children properly linked

This ensures that when permissions are fetched from the API, they are properly organized into a tree structure before being passed to the components.

### 2. Tree View Component Simplification

The `PermissionTreeViewComponent` was simplified to work with the improved hierarchical data structure:

- Removed complex logic for building parent-child relationships, as this is now handled by the service
- Simplified the `buildTreeNodes` method to directly convert root permissions to TreeNode objects
- Updated the `createTreeNode` method to recursively process children permissions

### 3. Expandable Rows in Table View

The table view was enhanced to support expandable rows for parent permissions:

- Modified the `GlobalTable` component to support row expansion functionality:
  - Added new inputs for `expandableRows` and `childrenField`
  - Added methods to handle row expansion and collapse
  - Updated the template to include expansion controls and row expansion template
- Updated the permissions list component to use the expandable rows functionality:
  - Added a template for displaying child permissions when a parent row is expanded
  - Configured the table to use the hierarchical permission data

### 4. Loading Indicators

Loading indicators were added to improve user experience during data fetching:

- Added a progress spinner to the `GlobalTable` component:
  - Imported PrimeNG's ProgressSpinnerModule
  - Added a loading spinner that displays when the loading property is true
  - Positioned the spinner centrally with proper spacing
- Both table and tree views now show consistent loading indicators when data is being fetched

## How It Works

1. When the application loads permissions, the `PermissionService.getPermissions()` method fetches data from the API
2. The service processes the raw data to build a proper hierarchical structure
3. Only root permissions are returned, with their children properly linked
4. The list component receives this data and passes it to either:
   - The table view (which displays a list with expandable rows for parent permissions)
   - The tree view (which displays the hierarchical structure)
5. In the table view:
   - Parent permissions have an expand/collapse button
   - Clicking the button shows/hides the child permissions
   - Child permissions are displayed in a styled container below the parent
6. In the tree view:
   - The PrimeNG Tree component displays the permissions in a tree structure
   - Children are grouped by their parents

## Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns: data processing in the service, display in the components
- Simplified component code
- Improved performance by avoiding redundant processing
- Better user experience with properly organized permissions in both views:
  - Table view with expandable rows for quick access to child permissions
  - Tree view for a complete hierarchical visualization
- Consistent data structure across different views
