# Permission Tree Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Permission Service Enhancement

The `PermissionService` was updated to properly organize permissions into a hierarchical structure. The key changes include:

- Added a new `buildPermissionTree` method that:
  - Creates a deep copy of permissions to avoid modifying the original data
  - Builds parent-child relationships by replacing child references with full child objects
  - Identifies root permissions (those that aren't children of any other permission)
  - Returns only root permissions with their children properly linked

This ensures that when permissions are fetched from the API, they are properly organized into a tree structure before being passed to the components.

### 2. Tree View Component Simplification

The `PermissionTreeViewComponent` was simplified to work with the improved hierarchical data structure:

- Removed complex logic for building parent-child relationships, as this is now handled by the service
- Simplified the `buildTreeNodes` method to directly convert root permissions to TreeNode objects
- Updated the `createTreeNode` method to recursively process children permissions

## How It Works

1. When the application loads permissions, the `PermissionService.getPermissions()` method fetches data from the API
2. The service processes the raw data to build a proper hierarchical structure
3. Only root permissions are returned, with their children properly linked
4. The list component receives this data and passes it to either:
   - The table view (which displays a flat list)
   - The tree view (which displays the hierarchical structure)
5. The tree view component converts the hierarchical permission data to PrimeNG TreeNode objects
6. The PrimeNG Tree component displays the permissions in a tree structure with children grouped by their parents

## Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns: data processing in the service, display in the components
- Simplified component code
- Improved performance by avoiding redundant processing
- Better user experience with a properly organized permission tree
